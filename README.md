# GHG-EMISSION
🌍 Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions Prediction
This project aims to predict Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions using machine learning techniques. GHG emissions are a major driver of climate change, and accurate forecasting can support sustainable policymaking, industrial compliance, and environmental planning.

📌 Project Objective
To build a data-driven model that predicts GHG emissions based on historical and environmental data. The ultimate goal is to enable better decision-making in reducing emissions and mitigating climate impacts.

📊 Dataset
The dataset used contains information such as:

Country/Region

Year

GDP

Population

Energy Use

Emission Levels (Target Variable)
